# VoiceRecognition_VOXCeleb
Neural Networks/Machine Learning

This notebook will create a speaker identification model from VOXCeleb website. The data was extracted for 10 speakers, merged and trained. My Classification Accuracy is greater than 0.9. I also used KMeans Cluster algorithm into 10 clusters
and found the membership assignment for each sample. Then I calculated how many samples were clustered together for each speaker.
